      <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="summary-content">
      <p>With EPIC funding, our project team is creating an open-source, friendly tool - i.e. the Home Power Planner - to guide homeowners and professionals through strategies for electrifying single-family homes with existing infrastructure where possible. We will use power efficient design strategies to support the Home Power Planner's tailored cost-effective recommendations. In developing the nuts and bolts of this tool, we will conduct field research and gather data of what exists in people's homes and how the tool performs. These demonstrations will show how our planning tool's power efficient design strategies work for electrifying different housing types and electrical setups.</p>

<!-- The Issue / Project Innovation -->
<div class="two-column">
  <div class="column-box">
    <h2>The Issue</h2>
    <p>A key barrier to home electrification is determining the "limits" of home and utility infrastructure when adding new electric loads. A common, and usually unneeded, practice is replacing panels with a larger size when installing a new electrical appliance or equipment. This panel upsizing practice can cost thousands and can delay projects for months. Upsizing also increases peak demand, requiring utilities to upgrade transformers, wires, and generation—costs passed to all ratepayers, hitting lower-income households hardest. Technical experts, leading contractors, and researchers have developed a better approach: power efficient design. This approach has been proven in real homes, but most homeowners, contractors, and officials do not know it is possible, and current planning tools provide little support.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column-box">
    <h2>Project Innovation</h2>
    <p>This project will create a free tool, the Home Power Planner, for home electrification with power efficient design recommendations – e.g. low-power and/or multifunctional appliances, load controls, and space-saving strategies. It will ensure National Electric Code (NEC) compliance – lowering perceived risks with novel approaches. Users will also be guided to resources for project execution. The Home Power Planner's open API will let other platforms integrate its features, expanding reach statewide. By standardizing assumptions, the Home Power Planner makes power efficient design easy for homeowners, contractors, and professionals – lowering costs, reducing grid strain, and enabling equitable electrification.</p>
